      <p>
        Cyberbullying is the use of cell phones, instant messaging, e-mail, chat
        rooms or social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter to harass,
        threaten or intimidate someone. Cyberbullying is often done by children,
        who have increasingly early access to these technologies.
